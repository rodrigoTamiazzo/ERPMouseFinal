          </li>
          <li>
            <h4 id="faq-question-8">What do I get?</h4>
            <p>You get a design sample as a graphic document. It usually contains a front and second page. In addition, we will include the original workfiles. Naturally, you are free to use these any way you choose.</p>
          </li>

            <h4 id="faq-question-9">How much time does it take you to do a design sample?</h4>

          </li>

          <li>
            <h4 id="faq-question-10">Where do you get the content from?</h4>
            <p>We use the content you send us on our briefing form. When information is lacking we will use "dummy texts" such as "Lorem ipsum" and "dummy images".</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4 id="faq-question-11">When do I need this service?</h4>
            <p>If you are unhappy with the current design of your website, if you are considering another vision for your website design, or would like to improve the "look and feel" of your site, if you are planning a new website and want to see a second design sample before you spend a lot of money on development, if you are a design company with no more ideas and want someone else to have a try.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
